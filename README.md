# Neural SHRED

This directory contains the implementation of the experiments presented in *Shallow Recurrent Decoders for Neural andã€€Behavioral Dynamics*

![Diagram of SHRED architecture](shred_diagram.png)

A *Shallow Recurrent Decoder* (SHRED) is composed of a *gated-recurrent unit* (GRU) that processes teporal dependency of sensor data and a *shallow decoder network* (SDN) that projects to the full state space. 

All experiments for the *C. elegans*, mouse, and zebrafish can be reconstructed using the `.ipynb` contained in this repository. The data for each model organism must be downloaded from the corresponding websites: 

- [*C.elegans*](https://osf.io/2395t/): Download WT_Stim.mat and copy file to `/neuralSHRED/worms/data`

- [Mouse](https://allensdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/visual_coding_neuropixels.html): the `.ipynb` for the mouse sections (expB) should contain all the information required to obtain the mouse data. If the code is unclear, refer to the `quick start guide (download .ipynb)` link on the Visual Coding- Neuropixel project website for more in-depth instructions. 

- [Zebrafish](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.2434) Download the `Neuronal activity in the forebrain` video located in the *Supplementary Information* section of the paper. Rename the movie to `forebrain.avi` and copy to `/neuralSHRED/zebra_fish/data`.


Next steps of this project is to use *Sparse Identification of Non-Linear DYnamics* (SINDy) with SHRED to further study the latent space dynamics. With this in mind, the iPython notebooks in this repository preemptively utilize the SHRED model defined in the SINDy-SHRED folder. The only difference in the model architecture is that the original SHRED code has a Long short-term memory (LSTM) as the RNN whereas the SINDySHRED model includes a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). Model performance is comparable and either can be used. 

To start, first install necessary dependencies by running the following in terminal: 
```bash
pip install -r ../neuralSHRED/sindy-shred-main/requirements.txt
```
